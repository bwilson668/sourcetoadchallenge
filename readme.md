## Instructions

The challenge consisted of 3 parts
1. Given an array of Guest information, pluck out information for a given key, even within the nested arrays.
2. Given an array of Guest information, sort the top level items by a given key, even if the key was within a nested array.
3. Create 2 or more classes that would allow a customer to order items from a cart.

## Execution

Problem 1 & 2 are solved in the `guestinfo.php` file.
Problem 3 is tackled in `checkout.php`.

## Reviewing

You can see the files in action on my website at (sourcetoad.benjaminandrewwilson.com)[https://sourcetoad.benjaminandrewwilson.com]

They are not the prettiest pages, but the problems focused more on the backend logic.
